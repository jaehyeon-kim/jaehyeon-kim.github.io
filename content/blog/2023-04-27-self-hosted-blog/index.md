I started blogging in 2014. At first, it was based on a simple Jekyll theme that supports posting a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file, which is converted from a [RMarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) file. Most of my work was in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) at that time and the simple theme was good enough, and it was hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It was around 2018 when I changed my blog with a single page application, which is built by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and hosted on AWS. Developing a blog site with it was fun as I was teaching myself web development while building an analytics portal at work. In 2020, I paused blogging for some time while expecting a baby and restarted publishing posts to my [company's blog page](https://cevo.com.au/author/jaehyeon-kim/) from mid-2021. It is good as I can have a post peer-reviewed and the company provides an incentive for each post published. However, it is not a convenient place to write small posts as I am recommended to keep in mind e.g. *how an article translates into better customer outcomes*. That is a good recommendation but not all posts can fit into it. Therefore, I thought I'd need something else for small and/or personal posts. I'd keep publishing to the company site, and I probably repost some of them to a new blog with delay.

I wouldn't like to use the existing site as it misses many features, and it'd take time to build those on my own. As I prefer a self-managed blog over a blog platform, I thought a [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) and GitHub Pages would be one of the quickest options. After searching mainly [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), Hugo caught up my eyes as it has [more themes with good features](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Among those I chose the [Hugo Bootstrap Theme](https://github.com/razonyang/hugo-theme-bootstrap). In this post, I'll demonstrate how I built/hosted this blog site in a couple of days.

## Quick Start

I used the [starter template](https://github.com/razonyang/hugo-theme-bootstrap-skeleton) of the [Hugo Bootstrap Theme](https://github.com/razonyang/hugo-theme-bootstrap). After installing _Node.js (16+)_, I cloned the template and installed NPN packages by executing `npm install`. Then I started the site using *docker-compose* with the following compose file shown below. Without docker, I had to install [_Hugo (0.97.0+)_](https://hbs.razonyang.com/v1/en/docs/getting-started/prerequisites/#build-tools) but the apt repo has an older version of it and I wouldn't like to be bothered to install a newer version from source. Using *docker-compose* is much easier way for me. Note it reloads the site when there is a change in the current directory so that updated contents can be checked on a browser seamlessly.

```yaml
version: "3.5"

services:
  hugo:
      image: klakegg/hugo:0.107.0-ext-ubuntu
      command: server -D -F -E --poll 700ms
      container_name: hugo
      volumes:
        - $PWD:/src
        - /etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs
      ports:
        - "1313:1313"
```

Below shows the site generated by the template by default. As it has way more sections and menus, I reduced those by updating configurations.

## Configuration Updates

The *config/_default* folder contains default configurations and I mainly updated site configs (*config.yaml*), site params (*params.yaml*) and menu configs (*menu.yaml*). Note they can be overridden by those in the *config/production* folder.

```bash
$ tree config
config
├── _default
│   ├── author.yaml
│   ├── config.yaml
│   ├── languages.yaml
│   ├── menu.yaml
│   ├── params.yaml
│   ├── server.yaml
│   └── social.yaml
└── production
    ├── config.yaml
    └── params.yaml
```

### Site Configuration

The [site configuration](https://hbs.razonyang.com/v1/en/docs/configuration/site/) section includes [Hugo-defined variables](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#all-configuration-settings). I mainly updated *title*, *copyright* and *taxonomies*. Also, the [*markup* config](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/) is added to override the default config of code highlighting and table of contents.

```yaml
# config/_default/config.yaml
baseURL: /
title: Jaehyeon
theme: github.com/razonyang/hugo-theme-bootstrap
copyright: 'Copyright © 2023-{year} Jaehyeon Kim. All Rights Reserved.'
defaultContentLanguage: en
...
taxonomies:
  category: categories
  series: series
  tag: tags
...
markup:
  highlight:
    lineNos: true
    lineNumbersInTable: false
    noClasses: false
  tableOfContents:
    endLevel: 6
    ordered: false
    startLevel: 2
```

### Site Parameters

The [site parameters](https://hbs.razonyang.com/v1/en/docs/configuration/site-params/) section includes specific config variables for the Hugo theme. Their names are mostly self-explanatory as well as many of them are explained by comments. Configuration of site parameters would require trials and errors, and we can quickly check the updated content thanks to Hugo's hot reloading feature.

```yaml
# config/_default/params.yaml
mainSections:
  - blog
  - posts
description: <description>
keywords: <keyword-1>, <keyword-2>
images:
  - site-feature-image.png

  numberifyHeadingsSeparator: . # The separator between of number and headings.
  imageTitleAsCaption: true
...

  paginate: 5 # Pagination. Default to 10.
  fuse:
    threshold: 0.1
...
topAppBar:
  social:
    github: <GitHub User ID>
    linkedin: <LinkedIn ID>
    paypal: <Paypal.Me Link ID>
```

### Menu Configuration

For now, I only need the blog menu and all other items are removed from the [menu configuration](https://hbs.razonyang.com/v1/en/docs/configuration/menu/).

```yaml
# config/_default/menu.yaml
main:
  - name: Blog
    identifier: blog
    params:
      icon: '<i class="fas fa-fw fa-blog text-warning"></i>'
      description:
```

### Production Configurations

As mentioned, the production configuration can be overridden. I added the base URL as it'll be hosted by a custom domain and the Google Analytics measurement ID.

```yaml
# config/production/config.yaml
baseURL: https://jaehyeon.me/
googleAnalytics: <Measurement ID>
```

### Add Extra Files

```bash

## Comment Widget

While it supports multiple [comment widgets](https://hbs.razonyang.com/v1/en/docs/widgets/comments/), I decided to use [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), which is a lightweight comment widget built on GitHub discussions.

I first enabled *Discussions* in the repository *Settings* as shown below.

![](discussion-1.png#center)

After that the *Discussions* tab is showing at the top and there are multiple discussion categories. The widget requires a category for comments, and I am going to use the *General* category.

![](discussion-2.png#center)

Then we need to install the widget as a GitHub app, and it can be installed by visiting its [GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/giscus).

![](giscus-1.png#center)

![](giscus-2.png#center)

The key configuration values for the widget are the repo name, repo ID and category ID. 

```yaml
# config/_default/params.yaml
...
giscus:
  repo: <repo-owner>/<repository-name>
  repoId: "<repository-id>"
  # category: ""
  categoryId: "<catetory-id>"
  # theme: "dark" # Default to auto.
  # mapping: "title" # Default to pathname.
  inputPosition: "bottom" # Default to top.
  reactions: true # Disable reactions.
  metadata: true # Emit discussion metadata.
  # lang: "en" # Specify language, default to site language.
  # lazyLoading: false # Default to true.
...
```

The repository and category IDs can be queries on the [GitHub GraphQL API Explorer](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer) as shown below. In the query, it is limited to show only the first one, and you may increase the number if the category you want to use is not queried.

```js
query {
  repository(owner: "<repo-owner>", name: "<repository-name>") {
    id # RepositoryID
    name
    discussionCategories(first: 1) {
      nodes {
        id # CategoryID
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "repository": {
      "id": "<repository-id>",
      "name": "<repository-name>",
      "discussionCategories": {
        "nodes": [
          {
            "id": "<catetory-id>",
            "name": "General"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
