I'm teaching myself [modern data streaming architectures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures.html) on AWS, and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is one of the key technologies, which can be used to messaging, activity tracking, stream processing and so on. While applications tend to be deployed to cloud, it can be much easier if we develop and test those with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) locally.
