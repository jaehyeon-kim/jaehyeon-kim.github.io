dbt CI/CD Workflows Using GitHub Actions

I recently have a chance to look into dbt CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions where BigQuery is used as the data warehouse.

One of the key workflows is to perform dbt slim CI where the updated dbt models are executed/tested using the dbt state method where it selects nodes by comparing them against a previous version of the same project.

The whole workflows would be

0. Upload an initial manifest.json into a cloud storage bucket.
1. Perform dbt slim CI.
▪ Download the latest manifest.json from the cloud storage bucket.
▪ Copy the main BigQuery datasets into CI datasets.
▪ Execute dbt run/test with the state method against the CI datasets.
▪ Delete the CI datasets.
▪▪ Use always() or succeeded() || failed() condition to ensure deletion.
2. Deploy the dbt model and docs only if the dbt slim ci is succeeded.
▪ Deploy the new dbt model into an artifact registry.
▪▪ Upload the manifest.json into the cloud storage bucket.
▪ Deploy the dbt docs into GitHub Pages.
