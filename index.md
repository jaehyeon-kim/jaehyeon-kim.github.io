title: Journey of Full Stack Data Products Development

{% include JB/setup %}

### Background

I studied economics and actuarial studies but I have been developing applications/database over the course of my major career. Due to the mixed backgrounds, I become interested in *full stack data product development*. The term of **data product** is borrowed from [data science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) of Coursera while **full stack development** is from the developer community.

For statistical or machine learning analysis, a process may be considered roughly as following.

* Data extraction and processing
* Exploratory analysis
* Model fitting
* Presentation of outcomes

When it comes to programming, a similar one may be

* ETL (Extract, Transform, Loading)
* Develop an application (client/server-side if a web application)
* Deploy the application

Therefore, to me, developing a *data product* covers ETL, processing/cleansing data, performing analysis and delivering outcomes in a reproducible or automated way, preferably in the form of application, if it can be considered as *full stack*.

I hope to share what I've learned on my journey.
