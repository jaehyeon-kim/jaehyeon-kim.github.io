As described in the Confluent document, Schema Registry provides a centralized repository for managing and validating schemas for topic message data, and for serialization and deserialization of the data over the network. Producers and consumers to Kafka topics can use schemas to ensure data consistency and compatibility as schemas evolve. In AWS, the Glue Schema Registry supports features to manage and enforce schemas on data streaming applications using convenient integrations with Apache Kafka, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink, and AWS Lambda.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-04-12-integrate-glue-schema-registry/featured.png" length="46040" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Simplify Streaming Ingestion on AWS â Part 2 MSK and Athena</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-03-14-simplify-streaming-ingestion-athena/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-03-14-simplify-streaming-ingestion-athena/</guid><description>In Part 1, we discussed a streaming ingestion solution using EventBridge, Lambda, MSK and Redshift Serverless.

An Aurora PostgreSQL cluster is deployed to host the source database and a Python command line app is used to create the database.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-12-19-datalake-demo-part3/featured.png" length="164526" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Lake Demo using Change Data Capture (CDC) on AWS â Part 2 Implement CDC</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-12-12-datalake-demo-part2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-12-12-datalake-demo-part2/</guid><description>In the previous post, we discussed a data lake solution where data ingestion is performed using change data capture (CDC) and the output files are upserted to an Apache Hudi table. Being registered to Glue Data Catalog, it can be used for ad-hoc queries and report/dashboard creation. The Northwind database is used as the source database and, following the transactional outbox pattern, order-related changes are _upserted _to an outbox table by triggers.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-12-12-datalake-demo-part2/featured.png" length="164526" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Lake Demo using Change Data Capture (CDC) on AWS â Part 1 Local Development</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-12-05-datalake-demo-part1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-12-05-datalake-demo-part1/</guid><description>Change data capture (CDC) is a proven data integration pattern that has a wide range of applications. Among those, data replication to data lakes is a good use case in data engineering. Coupled with best-in-breed data lake formats such as Apache Hudi, we can build an efficient data replication solution. This is the first post of the data lake demo series. Over time, we&amp;rsquo;ll build a data lake that uses CDC.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-12-05-datalake-demo-part1/featured.png" length="164526" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Local Development of AWS Glue 3.0 and Later</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-11-14-glue-3-local-development/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-11-14-glue-3-local-development/</guid><description>In an earlier post, I demonstrated how to set up a local development environment for AWS Glue 1.0 and 2.0 using a docker image that is published by the AWS Glue team and the Visual Studio Code Remote â Containers extension.

For development, a development endpoint is recommended, but it can be costly, inconvenient or unavailable (for Glue 2.0). The AWS Glue team published a Docker image that includes the AWS Glue binaries and all the dependencies packaged together. After inspecting it, I find some modifications are necessary in order to build a development environment on it.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2021-08-20-glue-local-development/featured.png" length="19535" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Thoughts on Apache Airflow AWS Lambda Operator</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2020-04-13-airflow-lambda-operator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2020-04-13-airflow-lambda-operator/</guid><description>Apache Airflow is a popular open-source workflow management platform. Typically tasks run remotely by Celery workers for scalability. In AWS, however, scalability can also be achieved using serverless computing services in a simpler way. For example, the ECS Operator allows to run dockerized tasks and, with the Fargate launch type, they can run in a serverless environment.
The ECS Operator alone is not sufficient because it can take up to several minutes to pull a Docker image and to set up network interface (for the case of Fargate launch type).</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2020-04-13-airflow-lambda-operator/featured.png" length="44994" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>AWS Local Development with LocalStack</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-07-20-aws-localstack/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-07-20-aws-localstack/</guid><description>LocalStack provides an easy-to-use test/mocking framework for developing AWS applications. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to utilize LocalStack for development using a web service.
Specifically a simple web service built with Flask-RestPlus is used. It supports simple CRUD operations against a database table. It is set that SQS and Lambda are used for creating and updating a record. When a POST or PUT request is made, the service sends a message to a SQS queue and directly returns 204 reponse.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-07-20-aws-localstack/featured.png" length="164886" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Serverless Data Product POC Backend Part IV - Serving R ML Model via S3</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-17-serverless-data-product-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-17-serverless-data-product-4/</guid><description>In the previous posts, it is discussed how to package/deploy an R model with AWS Lambda and to expose the Lambda function via Amazon API Gateway. Main benefits of serverless architecture is cost-effectiveness and being hassle-free from provisioning/managing servers. While the API returns a predicted admission status value given GRE, GPA and Rank, there is an issue if it is served within a web application: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This post discusses how to resolve this issue by updating API configuration and the Lambda function handler with a simple web application.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-17-serverless-data-product-4/featured.png" length="225463" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Serverless Data Product POC Backend Part III - Exposing R ML Model via APIG</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-13-serverless-data-product-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-13-serverless-data-product-3/</guid><description>In Part I of this series, R and necessary libraries/packages together with a Lambda function handler are packaged and saved to Amazon S3.

It is also a cost-effective way of delivering a data product as functions are executed on-demand rather than in servers that run 24/7. Furthermore AWS Lambda free tier includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month, which is available to both existing and new AWS customers indefinitely.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-11-serverless-data-product-2/featured.png" length="139725" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Serverless Data Product POC Backend Part I - Packaging R ML Model for Lambda</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-08-serverless-data-product-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-08-serverless-data-product-1/</guid><description><![CDATA[Let say you&rsquo;ve got a prediction model built in R and you&rsquo;d like to productionize it, for example, by serving it in a web application. One way is exposing the model through an API that returns the predicted result as a web service. However there are many issues. Firstly R is not a language for API development although there may be some ways - eg the plumber package.
