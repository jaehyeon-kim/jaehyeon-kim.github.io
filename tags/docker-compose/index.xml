For backfilling or troubleshooting, however, we need to consume messages from a certain timestamp occasionally. The Kafka consumer class of the kafka-python package has a method to seek a particular offset for a topic partition. Therefore, if we know which topic partition to choose e.g. by assigning a topic partition, we can easily override the fetch offset.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-01-10-kafka-consumer-seek-offsets/featured.png" length="47217" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Revisit AWS Lambda Invoke Function Operator of Apache Airflow</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-08-06-revisit-lambda-operator/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-08-06-revisit-lambda-operator/</guid><description>Apache Airflow is a popular workflow management platform. A wide range of AWS services are integrated with the platform by Amazon AWS Operators. AWS Lambda is one of the integrated services, and it can be used to develop workflows efficiently. The current Lambda Operator, however, just invokes a Lambda function, and it can fail to report the invocation result of a function correctly and to record the exact error message from failure.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-08-06-revisit-lambda-operator/featured.png" length="24814" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Warehousing ETL Demo with Apache Iceberg on EMR Local Environment</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-06-26-iceberg-etl-demo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-06-26-iceberg-etl-demo/</guid><description>Unlike traditional Data Lake, new table formats (Iceberg, Hudi and Delta Lake) support features that can be used to apply data warehousing patterns, which can bring a way to be rescued from Data Swamp.

It has multiple deployment options that cover EC2, EKS, Outposts and Serverless. For development and testing, EMR Notebooks or EMR Studio can be an option. Both provide a Jupyter Notebook environment and the former is only available for EMR on EC2. There are cases, however, that development (and learning) is performed in a local environment more efficiently. The AWS Glue team understands this demand, and they illustrate how to make use of a custom Docker image for Glue in a recent blog post.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-05-08-emr-local-dev/featured.png" length="25693" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Use External Schema Registry with MSK Connect â Part 2 MSK Deployment</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-04-03-schema-registry-part2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-04-03-schema-registry-part2/</guid><description>In the previous post, we discussed a Change Data Capture (CDC) solution with a schema registry. A local development environment is set up using Docker Compose. The Debezium and Confluent S3 connectors are deployed with the Confluent Avro converter and the Apicurio registry is used as the schema registry service. A quick example is shown to illustrate how schema evolution can be managed by the schema registry. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll build the solution on AWS using MSK, MSK Connect, Aurora PostgreSQL and ECS.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-04-03-schema-registry-part2/featured.png" length="59689" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Use External Schema Registry with MSK Connect â Part 1 Local Development</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-03-07-schema-registry-part1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-03-07-schema-registry-part1/</guid><description>When we discussed a Change Data Capture (CDC) solution in one of the earlier posts, we used the JSON converter that comes with Kafka Connect.

Typically tasks run remotely by Celery workers for scalability. In AWS, however, scalability can also be achieved using serverless computing services in a simpler way. For example, the ECS Operator allows to run dockerized tasks and, with the Fargate launch type, they can run in a serverless environment.
The ECS Operator alone is not sufficient because it can take up to several minutes to pull a Docker image and to set up network interface (for the case of Fargate launch type).</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2020-04-13-airflow-lambda-operator/featured.png" length="44994" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Dynamic Routing and Centralized Auth with Traefik, Python and R Example</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-29-traefik-example/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-29-traefik-example/</guid><description>Ingress in Kubernetes exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. By setting rules, it routes requests to appropriate services (precisely requests are sent to individual Pods by Ingress Controller). Rules can be set up dynamically and I find it&amp;rsquo;s more efficient compared to traditional reverse proxy.
Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer and it can be used as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-29-traefik-example/featured.png" length="139790" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Distributed Task Queue with Python and R Example</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-15-task-queue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-15-task-queue/</guid><description>While I&amp;rsquo;m looking into Apache Airflow, a workflow management tool, I thought it would be beneficial to get some understanding of how Celery works.

FastAPI is used for developing the web service and Redis is used for the message broker and result backend. During the development, I thought it would be possible to implement similar functionality in R with Rserve.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-15-task-queue/featured.png" length="51615" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Linux Dev Environment on Windows</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-01-linux-on-windows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-01-linux-on-windows/</guid><description>I use Linux containers a lot for development.
