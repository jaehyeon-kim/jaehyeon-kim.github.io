They obtain the statistics in different angles. The first pipeline emits the global average lengths whenever a new input text arrives while the latter triggers those values in a sliding time window.

Often it is faster and simpler to identify and fix bugs on the pipeline code by performing local unit testing. Moreover, especially when it comes to creating a streaming pipeline, unit testing cases can facilitate development further by using TestStream as it allows us to advance watermarks or processing time according to different scenarios. In this post, we discuss how to perform unit testing of the batch and streaming pipelines that we developed earlier.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-09-beam-local-dev-5/featured.png" length="53603" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Apache Beam Local Development with Python - Part 4 Streaming Pipelines</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-02-beam-local-dev-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-02-beam-local-dev-4/</guid><description>In Part 3, we discussed the portability layer of Apache Beam as it helps understand (1) how Python pipelines run on the Flink Runner and (2) how multiple SDKs can be used in a single pipeline, followed by demonstrating local Flink and Kafka cluster creation for developing streaming pipelines.

Flink has DataStream and Table/SQL APIs and the former has more capacity to develop sophisticated data streaming applications. The DataStream API of PyFlink, Flink&amp;rsquo;s Python API, however, is not as complete as its Java counterpart, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide enough capability to extend when there are missing features in Python. Recently I had a chance to look through Apache Beam and found it supports more possibility to extend and/or customise its features.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-03-28-beam-local-dev-1/featured.png" length="88260" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Setup Local Development Environment for Apache Flink and Spark Using EMR Container Images</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-12-07-flink-spark-local-dev/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-12-07-flink-spark-local-dev/</guid><description>Apache Flink became generally available for Amazon EMR on EKS from the EMR 6.15.0 releases, and we are able to pull the Flink (as well as Spark) container images from the ECR Public Gallery.
