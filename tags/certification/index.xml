CKAD has been developed by The Linux Foundation and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), to help expand the Kubernetes ecosystem through standardized training and certification. Specifically this certification is for Kubernetes engineers, cloud engineers and other IT professionals responsible for building, deploying, and configuring cloud native applications with Kubernetes. In this post, I will summarise how I prepared for the exam by reviewing three online courses and two practice tests that I went through.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-10-12-how-i-prepared-for-ckad/featured.png" length="5945" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>How I Prepared for Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka as a Non-Java Developer</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-11-how-i-prepared-for-ccdak/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-11-how-i-prepared-for-ccdak/</guid><description>I recently obtained the Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka (CCDAK) certification. It focuses on knowledge of developing applications that work with Kafka, and is targeted to developers and solutions architects. As it assumes Java APIs for development and testing, I am contacted to share how I prepared for it as a non-Java developer from time to time. I thought it would be better to write a post to summarise how I did it rather than answering to them individually.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-11-how-i-prepared-for-ccdak/featured.png" length="215227" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
