Having Windows computers at home and work, I used to use Linux VMs on VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation. It&rsquo;s not a bad option but it requires a lot of resources. Recently, after my home computer was updated, I was not able to start my hypervisor anymore. Also I didn&rsquo;t like huge resource consumption of it so that I began to look for a different development environment. A while ago, I played with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> and it was alright. Also <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code (VSCode)<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>, <em>my favourite editor</em>, now supports <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remote development<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>. Initially I thought I would be able to create a new development environment with WSL and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker for Windows<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>. However it was until I tried a bigger app with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Compose<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> that Docker for Windows has a number of issues especially when containers are started by Docker Compose in WSL. I didn&rsquo;t like to spend too much time on fixing those issues as I concerned those might not be the only ones. Then I decided to install a Linux VM on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyper-V<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>. Luckly VSCode also supports a remote VM via SSH.</p>]]></description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-01-linux-on-windows/featured.png" length="187978" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
