The former is triggered when a pull request is created to the main branch, and it builds only modified models and its first-order children in a <em>ci</em> dataset, followed by performing tests on them. The second workflow gets triggered once a pull request is merged. Beginning with running unit tests, it packages the <em>dbt</em> project as a Docker container and publishes to <em>Artifact Registry</em>. In this post, we focus on how to deploy a <em>dbt</em> project in multiple environments while walking through the entire CI/CD process step-by-step.</p>]]></description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-09-13-dbt-guide/featured.png" length="71185" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>DBT CI/CD Demo with BigQuery and GitHub Actions</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-09-05-dbt-cicd-demo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-09-05-dbt-cicd-demo/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Continuous integration (CI) is the process of ensuring new code integrates with the larger code base, and it puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch. Continuous delivery (CD) is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. CI/CD helps development teams avoid bugs and code failures while maintaining a continuous cycle of software development and updates. In this post, we discuss how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data build tool (<em>dbt</em>)<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> project using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> where <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BigQuery<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> is used as the target data warehouse.</p>]]></description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-09-05-dbt-cicd-demo/featured.png" length="60835" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) Pizza Shop Demo - Part 4 ETL on BigQuery via Airflow</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-22-dbt-pizza-shop-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-22-dbt-pizza-shop-4/</guid><description>In Part 3, we developed a dbt project that targets Google BigQuery with fictional pizza shop data. Two dimension tables that keep product and user records are created as Type 2 slowly changing dimension (SCD Type 2) tables, and one transactional fact table is built to keep pizza orders. The fact table is denormalized using nested and repeated fields for improving query performance. In this post, we discuss how to set up an ETL process on the project using Apache Airflow.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-22-dbt-pizza-shop-4/featured.png" length="89588" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) Pizza Shop Demo - Part 3 Modelling on BigQuery</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-08-dbt-pizza-shop-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-08-dbt-pizza-shop-3/</guid><description>In this series, we discuss practical examples of data warehouse and lakehouse development where data transformation is performed by the data build tool (dbt) and ETL is managed by Apache Airflow. In Part 1, we developed a dbt project on PostgreSQL using fictional pizza shop data. At the end, the data sets are modelled by two SCD type 2 dimension tables and one transactional fact table. In this post, we create a new dbt project that targets Google BigQuery.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-08-dbt-pizza-shop-3/featured.png" length="70297" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
