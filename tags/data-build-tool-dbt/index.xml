In Part 1, we developed a dbt project on PostgreSQL using fictional pizza shop data. At the end, the data sets are modelled by two SCD type 2 dimension tables and one transactional fact table. In this post, we create a new dbt project that targets Google BigQuery.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-08-dbt-pizza-shop-3/featured.png" length="70297" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) Pizza Shop Demo - Part 2 ETL on PostgreSQL via Airflow</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-25-dbt-pizza-shop-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-25-dbt-pizza-shop-2/</guid><description>In this series of posts, we discuss data warehouse/lakehouse examples using data build tool (dbt) including ETL orchestration with Apache Airflow. In Part 1, we developed a dbt project on PostgreSQL with fictional pizza shop data. Two dimension tables that keep product and user records are created as Type 2 slowly changing dimension (SCD Type 2) tables, and one transactional fact table is built to keep pizza orders. In this post, we discuss how to set up an ETL process on the project using Airflow.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-25-dbt-pizza-shop-2/featured.png" length="77355" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) Pizza Shop Demo - Part 1 Modelling on PostgreSQL</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-18-dbt-pizza-shop-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-18-dbt-pizza-shop-1/</guid><description>The data build tool (dbt) is a popular data transformation tool for data warehouse development. Moreover, it can be used for data lakehouse development thanks to open table formats such as Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi and Delta Lake. dbt supports key AWS analytics services and I wrote a series of posts that discuss how to utilise dbt with Redshift, Glue, EMR on EC2, EMR on EKS, and Athena. Those posts focus on platform integration, however, they do not show realistic ETL scenarios.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-18-dbt-pizza-shop-1/featured.png" length="85093" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) for Effective Data Transformation on AWS – Part 5 Athena</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-12-06-dbt-on-aws-part-5-athena/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-12-06-dbt-on-aws-part-5-athena/</guid><description>The data build tool (dbt) is an effective data transformation tool and it supports key AWS analytics services - Redshift, Glue, EMR and Athena.

In part 1 of the dbt on AWS series, we discuss data transformation pipelines using dbt on Redshift Serverless. Subsets of IMDb data are used as source and data models are developed in multiple layers according to the dbt best practices.
Part 1 Redshift (this post) Part 2 Glue Part 3 EMR on EC2 Part 4 EMR on EKS Part 5 Athena Motivation In our experience delivering data solutions for our customers, we have observed a desire to move away from a centralised team function, responsible for the data collection, analysis and reporting, towards shifting this responsibility to an organisation&amp;rsquo;s lines of business (LOB) teams.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-09-28-dbt-on-aws-part-1-redshift/featured.png" length="97234" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
