At first, it was based on a simple Jekyll theme that supports posting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> files, which are converted from <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R Markdown<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> files. Most of my work was in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> at that time and the simple theme was good enough, and it was hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>. It was around 2018 when I changed my blog with a single page application, built by <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> and hosted on AWS. It was fun as I was teaching myself web development while building an analytics portal at work. In 2020, I paused blogging for some time while expecting a baby and restarted publishing posts to my <a href="https://cevo.com.au/author/jaehyeon-kim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company&rsquo;s blog page<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> from mid-2021. It is good as I can have peer-reviews and the company provides an incentive for each post published. However, it is not the right place to publish all the posts that I plan. For example, I am recommended to keep in mind e.g. <em>how an article translates into better customer outcomes</em>. That&rsquo;s understandable but not all posts can fit into it. Currently, I am teaching myself <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern data streaming architectures<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>, and some articles could be inadequate for customers until I gain competency. Therefore, I thought I need another place that I can publish posts without worrying about undermining my company&rsquo;s reputation. I&rsquo;d keep publishing to the company site, and I probably repost some of them to this new blog with delay.</p>]]></description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-04-24-self-hosted-blog/featured.png" length="41850" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
