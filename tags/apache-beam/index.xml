Same as Part I, we deploy a Kafka cluster using the Strimzi Operator on a minikube cluster as the pipeline uses Apache Kafka topics for its data source and sink. Then, we develop the pipeline as a Python package and add the package to a custom Docker image so that Python user code can be executed externally.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-06-06-beam-deploy-2/featured.png" length="58020" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Apache Beam Local Development with Python - Part 5 Testing Pipelines</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-09-beam-local-dev-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-09-beam-local-dev-5/</guid><description>We developed batch and streaming pipelines in Part 2 and Part 4. Often it is faster and simpler to identify and fix bugs on the pipeline code by performing local unit testing. Moreover, especially when it comes to creating a streaming pipeline, unit testing cases can facilitate development further by using TestStream as it allows us to advance watermarks or processing time according to different scenarios. In this post, we discuss how to perform unit testing of the batch and streaming pipelines that we developed earlier.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-09-beam-local-dev-5/featured.png" length="53603" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Apache Beam Local Development with Python - Part 4 Streaming Pipelines</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-02-beam-local-dev-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-02-beam-local-dev-4/</guid><description>In Part 3, we discussed the portability layer of Apache Beam as it helps understand (1) how Python pipelines run on the Flink Runner and (2) how multiple SDKs can be used in a single pipeline, followed by demonstrating local Flink and Kafka cluster creation for developing streaming pipelines. In this post, we build a streaming pipeline that aggregates page visits by user in a fixed time window of 20 seconds.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-05-02-beam-local-dev-4/featured.png" length="54556" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Apache Beam Local Development with Python - Part 3 Flink Runner</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-04-18-beam-local-dev-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-04-18-beam-local-dev-3/</guid><description>In this series, we discuss local development of Apache Beam pipelines using Python. In the previous posts, we mainly talked about Batch pipelines with/without Beam SQL. Beam pipelines are portable between batch and streaming semantics, and we will discuss streaming pipeline development in this and the next posts. While there are multiple Beam Runners, not every Runner supports Python or some Runners have too limited features in streaming semantics - see Beam Capability Matrix for details.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-04-18-beam-local-dev-3/featured.png" length="262307" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Apache Beam Local Development with Python - Part 2 Batch Pipelines</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-04-04-beam-local-dev-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-04-04-beam-local-dev-2/</guid><description>In this series, we discuss local development of Apache Beam pipelines using Python. A basic Beam pipeline was introduced in Part 1, followed by demonstrating how to utilise Jupyter notebooks, Beam SQL and Beam DataFrames. In this post, we discuss Batch pipelines that aggregate website visit log by user and time. The pipelines are developed with and without Beam SQL. Additionally, each pipeline is implemented on a Jupyter notebook for demonstration.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-04-04-beam-local-dev-2/featured.png" length="55405" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Apache Beam Local Development with Python - Part 1 Pipeline, Notebook, SQL and DataFrame</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-03-28-beam-local-dev-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-03-28-beam-local-dev-1/</guid><description>Apache Beam and Apache Flink are open-source frameworks for parallel, distributed data processing at scale. Flink has DataStream and Table/SQL APIs and the former has more capacity to develop sophisticated data streaming applications. The DataStream API of PyFlink, Flink&amp;rsquo;s Python API, however, is not as complete as its Java counterpart, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide enough capability to extend when there are missing features in Python. Recently I had a chance to look through Apache Beam and found it supports more possibility to extend and/or customise its features.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-03-28-beam-local-dev-1/featured.png" length="88260" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
