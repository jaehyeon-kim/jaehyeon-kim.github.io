In this post, the APIs are deployed in a Docker container and, after showing example requests, their performance is compared. The rocker/r-ver:3.4 is used as the base image and each of the APIs is added to it. For simplicity, the APIs are served by Supervisor. For performance testing, Locust is used. The source of this post can be found in this GitHub repository.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-19-api-development-with-r-2/featured.png" length="367256" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>API Development with R Part I</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-18-api-development-with-r-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-18-api-development-with-r-1/</guid><description>API is an effective way of distributing analysis outputs to external clients. When it comes to API development with R, however, there are not many choices. Probably development would be made with plumber, Rserve, rApache or OpenCPU if a client or bridge layer to R is not considered.
This is 2 part series in relation to API development with R. In this post, serving an R function with plumber, Rserve and rApache is discussed.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-18-api-development-with-r-1/featured.png" length="367256" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
