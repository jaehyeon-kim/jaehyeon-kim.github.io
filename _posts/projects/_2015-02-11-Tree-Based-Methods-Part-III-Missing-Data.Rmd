### Missing Data

CART tries to find a predictor and a split (*s*) for which the following is as large as possible.

$$
\triangle I\left(s,A\right)= I\left(A\right) - p\left(A_{L}\right) I\left(A_{L}\right) - p\left(A_{R}\right) I\left(A_{R}\right)
$$

- Parent impurity: $$I\left(A\right)$$
- Probabilities of falling in the left and right node: ($$p\left(A_{L}\right), \; p\left(A_{R}\right)$$)

1. Splits are determined without missing values while the probabilities are re-estimated.
2. Actual splits of the missing values are performed by **surrogate variables**

Supposed there are $$x_{1}$$ to $$x_{10}$$ perdictors. $$x_{1}$$ happens to be split and it has missing values.
