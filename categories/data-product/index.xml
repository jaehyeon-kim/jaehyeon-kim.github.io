To do so, I built a simple web service that sends tasks to Celery workers and collects the results from them. FastAPI is used for developing the web service and Redis is used for the message broker and result backend. During the development, I thought it would be possible to implement similar functionality in R with Rserve.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2019-11-15-task-queue/featured.png" length="51615" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Shiny to Vue.js</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-26-shiny-to-vue.js/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-26-shiny-to-vue.js/</guid><description>In the last post, the async feature of Shiny was discussed. Although it is a remarkable step forward to web development in R, it is not to the full extent that a Javascript application can bring. In fact, (long running) requests of a user (or session) are not impacted by those of other users (or sessions) but, for a given user, all requests are handled sequentially. On the other hand, it is not the case for a Javascript-backed app where all requests are processed asynchronously.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-26-shiny-to-vue.js/featured.png" length="247205" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Async Shiny and Its Limitation</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-19-asyn-shiny-and-its-limitation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-19-asyn-shiny-and-its-limitation/</guid><description>A Shiny app is served by one (single-threaded blocking) process by Open Source Shiny Server. This causes a scalability issue because all requests are handled one by one in a queue. Recently the creator of Shiny introduced the promises package, which brings asynchronous programming capabilities to R. This is a remarkable step forward to web development in R.
In this post, it&amp;rsquo;ll be demonstrated how to implement the async feature of Shiny.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-19-asyn-shiny-and-its-limitation/featured.png" length="247205" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>API Development with R Part II</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-19-api-development-with-r-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-19-api-development-with-r-2/</guid><description>In Part I, it is discussed how to serve an R function with plumber, Rserve and rApache. In this post, the APIs are deployed in a Docker container and, after showing example requests, their performance is compared. The rocker/r-ver:3.4 is used as the base image and each of the APIs is added to it. For simplicity, the APIs are served by Supervisor. For performance testing, Locust is used. The source of this post can be found in this GitHub repository.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-19-api-development-with-r-2/featured.png" length="367256" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>API Development with R Part I</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-18-api-development-with-r-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-18-api-development-with-r-1/</guid><description>API is an effective way of distributing analysis outputs to external clients. When it comes to API development with R, however, there are not many choices. Probably development would be made with plumber, Rserve, rApache or OpenCPU if a client or bridge layer to R is not considered.
This is 2 part series in relation to API development with R. In this post, serving an R function with plumber, Rserve and rApache is discussed.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-11-18-api-development-with-r-1/featured.png" length="367256" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Serverless Data Product POC Backend Part IV - Serving R ML Model via S3</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-17-serverless-data-product-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-17-serverless-data-product-4/</guid><description>In the previous posts, it is discussed how to package/deploy an R model with AWS Lambda and to expose the Lambda function via Amazon API Gateway. Main benefits of serverless architecture is cost-effectiveness and being hassle-free from provisioning/managing servers. While the API returns a predicted admission status value given GRE, GPA and Rank, there is an issue if it is served within a web application: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This post discusses how to resolve this issue by updating API configuration and the Lambda function handler with a simple web application.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-17-serverless-data-product-4/featured.png" length="225463" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Serverless Data Product POC Backend Part III - Exposing R ML Model via APIG</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-13-serverless-data-product-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-13-serverless-data-product-3/</guid><description>In Part I of this series, R and necessary libraries/packages together with a Lambda function handler are packaged and saved to Amazon S3. Then, in Part II, the package is deployed at AWS Lambda after creating and assigning a role to the Lambda function. Although the Lambda function can be called via the Invoke API, it&amp;rsquo;ll be much more useful if the function can be called as a web service (or API).</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-13-serverless-data-product-3/featured.png" length="173293" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Serverless Data Product POC Backend Part II - Deploying R ML Model via Lambda</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-11-serverless-data-product-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-11-serverless-data-product-2/</guid><description>In the previous post, serverless event-driven application development is introduced. Also how to package R, necessary libraries/packages and a Lambda function handler is discussed. No need of provisioning/managing servers is one of the key benefits of the architecture. It is also a cost-effective way of delivering a data product as functions are executed on-demand rather than in servers that run 24/7. Furthermore AWS Lambda free tier includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month, which is available to both existing and new AWS customers indefinitely.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-11-serverless-data-product-2/featured.png" length="139725" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Serverless Data Product POC Backend Part I - Packaging R ML Model for Lambda</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-08-serverless-data-product-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-08-serverless-data-product-1/</guid><description><![CDATA[Let say you&rsquo;ve got a prediction model built in R and you&rsquo;d like to productionize it, for example, by serving it in a web application. One way is exposing the model through an API that returns the predicted result as a web service. However there are many issues. Firstly R is not a language for API development although there may be some ways - eg the plumber package. More importantly developing an API is not the end of the story as the API can&rsquo;t be served in a production system if it is not deployed/managed/upgraded/patched/&hellip; appropriately in a server or if it is not scalable, protected via authentication/authorization and so on.]]></description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2017-04-08-serverless-data-product-1/featured.png" length="139725" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Some Thoughts on Shiny Open Source - Render Multiple Pages</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2016-06-27-shiny-open-source-render-multiple-pages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2016-06-27-shiny-open-source-render-multiple-pages/</guid><description>R Shiny applications are served as a single page application and it is not built to render multiple pages. There are benefits of rendering multiple pages such as code management and implement authentication. In this page, we discuss how to implement multi-page rendering in a Shiny app.
As indicated above, Shiny is not designed to render multiple pages and, in general, the UI is rendered on the fly as defined in ui.</description></item><item><title>Some Thoughts on Shiny Open Source - Internal Load Balancing</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2016-05-23-shiny-open-source-internal-load-balancing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2016-05-23-shiny-open-source-internal-load-balancing/</guid><description>Shiny is an interesting web framework that helps create a web application quickly. If it targets a large number of users, however, there are several limitations and it is so true when the open source version of Shiny is in use. It would be possible to tackle down some of the limitations with the enterprise version but it is not easy to see enough examples of Shiny applications in production environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
