In this post, I will summarise how I prepared for the exam by reviewing three online courses and two practice tests that I went through.</p>]]></description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-10-12-how-i-prepared-for-ckad/featured.png" length="5945" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>How I Prepared for Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka as a Non-Java Developer</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-11-how-i-prepared-for-ccdak/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-11-how-i-prepared-for-ccdak/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I recently obtained the <a href="https://www.confluent.io/certification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka (CCDAK)<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> certification. It focuses on knowledge of developing applications that work with Kafka, and is targeted to developers and solutions architects. As it assumes Java APIs for development and testing, I am contacted to share how I prepared for it as a non-Java developer from time to time. I thought it would be better to write a post to summarise how I did it rather than answering to them individually.</p>]]></description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-11-how-i-prepared-for-ccdak/featured.png" length="215227" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Self-managed Blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-04-24-self-hosted-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-04-24-self-hosted-blog/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging in 2014. At first, it was based on a simple Jekyll theme that supports posting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> files, which are converted from <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R Markdown<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> files. Most of my work was in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> at that time and the simple theme was good enough, and it was hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>. It was around 2018 when I changed my blog with a single page application, built by <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> and hosted on AWS. It was fun as I was teaching myself web development while building an analytics portal at work. In 2020, I paused blogging for some time while expecting a baby and restarted publishing posts to my <a href="https://cevo.com.au/author/jaehyeon-kim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company&rsquo;s blog page<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> from mid-2021. It is good as I can have peer-reviews and the company provides an incentive for each post published. However, it is not the right place to publish all the posts that I plan. For example, I am recommended to keep in mind e.g. <em>how an article translates into better customer outcomes</em>. That&rsquo;s understandable but not all posts can fit into it. Currently, I am teaching myself <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern data streaming architectures<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>, and some articles could be inadequate for customers until I gain competency. Therefore, I thought I need another place that I can publish posts without worrying about undermining my company&rsquo;s reputation. I&rsquo;d keep publishing to the company site, and I probably repost some of them to this new blog with delay.</p>]]></description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-04-24-self-hosted-blog/featured.png" length="41850" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Some Thoughts on Python for R Users</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2015-08-09-some-thoughts-on-python-for-r-users/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2015-08-09-some-thoughts-on-python-for-r-users/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>There seem to be growing interest in Python in the R cummunity. While there can be a range of opinions about using R over Python (or vice versa) for exploratory data analysis, fitting statistical/machine learning algorithms and so on, I consider one of the strongest attractions of using Python comes from the fact that <em>Python is a general purpose programming language</em>. As more developers are involved in, it can provide a way to get jobs done easily, which can be tricky in R. In this article, an example is introduced by illustrating how to connect to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> web services.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Some Thoughts on Python</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2015-08-08-some-thoughts-on-python/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2015-08-08-some-thoughts-on-python/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>When I bagan to teach myself C# 3 years ago, I only had some experience in interactive analysis tools such as MATLAB and R - I didn&rsquo;t consider R as a programming language at that time. The general purpose programming language shares some common features (data type, loop, if&hellip;) but it is rather different in the way how code is written/organized, which is object oriented. Therefore, while it was not a problem to grap the common features, it took quite some time to understand and keep my code in an object oriented way.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
