Although it is a remarkable step forward to web development in R, it is not to the full extent that a Javascript application can bring. In fact, (long running) requests of a user (or session) are not impacted by those of other users (or sessions) but, for a given user, all requests are handled sequentially. On the other hand, it is not the case for a Javascript-backed app where all requests are processed asynchronously.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-26-shiny-to-vue.js/featured.png" length="247205" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Async Shiny and Its Limitation</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-19-asyn-shiny-and-its-limitation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-19-asyn-shiny-and-its-limitation/</guid><description>A Shiny app is served by one (single-threaded blocking) process by Open Source Shiny Server. This causes a scalability issue because all requests are handled one by one in a queue. Recently the creator of Shiny introduced the promises package, which brings asynchronous programming capabilities to R. This is a remarkable step forward to web development in R.
In this post, it&amp;rsquo;ll be demonstrated how to implement the async feature of Shiny.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2018-05-19-asyn-shiny-and-its-limitation/featured.png" length="247205" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
