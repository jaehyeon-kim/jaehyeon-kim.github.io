The data build tool (dbt) is an effective data transformation tool and it supports key AWS analytics services - Redshift, Glue, EMR and Athena. In the previous posts, we discussed benefits of a common data transformation tool and the potential of dbt to cover a wide range of data projects from data warehousing to data lake to data lakehouse. Demo data projects that target Redshift Serverless, Glue, EMR on EC2 and EMR on EKS are illustrated as well.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-12-06-dbt-on-aws-part-5-athena/featured.png" length="91796" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) for Effective Data Transformation on AWS – Part 4 EMR on EKS</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-11-01-dbt-on-aws-part-4-emr-eks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2022-11-01-dbt-on-aws-part-4-emr-eks/</guid><description>This article was originally posted on Tech Insights of Cevo Australia.
