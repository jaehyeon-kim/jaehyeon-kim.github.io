One of the key benefits of client authentication is achieving user access control. Kafka ships with a pluggable, out-of-the box authorization framework, which is configured with the authorizer.class.name property in the server configuration and stores Access Control Lists (ACLs) in the cluster metadata (either Zookeeper or the KRaft metadata log). In this post, we will discuss how to configure Kafka authorization with Java and Python client examples while SASL is kept for client authentication.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-07-20-kafka-development-with-docker-part-11/featured.png" length="458848" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Kafka Development with Docker - Part 10 SASL Authentication</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-07-13-kafka-development-with-docker-part-10/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-07-13-kafka-development-with-docker-part-10/</guid><description>In the previous post, we discussed TLS (SSL or TLS/SSL) authentication to improve security. It enforces two-way verification where a client certificate is verified by Kafka brokers. Client authentication can also be enabled by Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), and we will discuss how to implement SASL authentication with Java and Python client examples in this post.

SSL encryption is a one-way verification process where a server certificate is verified by a client via SSL Handshake. To improve security, we can add client authentication either by enforcing two-way verification where a client certificate is verified by Kafka brokers (SSL authentication). Or we can choose a separate authentication mechanism, which is typically Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL).</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-07-06-kafka-development-with-docker-part-9/featured.png" length="471471" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Kafka Development with Docker - Part 8 SSL Encryption</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-29-kafka-development-with-docker-part-8/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-29-kafka-development-with-docker-part-8/</guid><description>By default, Apache Kafka communicates in PLAINTEXT, which means that all data is sent without being encrypted. To secure communication, we can configure Kafka clients and other components to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. Note that TLS is also referred to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or TLS/SSL. SSL is the predecessor of TLS, and has been deprecated since June 2015. However, it is used in configuration and code instead of TLS for historical reasons.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-29-kafka-development-with-docker-part-8/featured.png" length="469311" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Kafka Development with Docker - Part 7 Producer and Consumer with Glue Schema Registry</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-22-kafka-development-with-docker-part-7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-22-kafka-development-with-docker-part-7/</guid><description>In Part 4, we developed Kafka producer and consumer applications using the kafka-python package.

Producers and consumers to Kafka topics can use schemas to ensure data consistency and compatibility as schemas evolve. In AWS, the Glue Schema Registry supports features to manage and enforce schemas on data streaming applications using convenient integrations with Apache Kafka, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink, and AWS Lambda.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-08-kafka-development-with-docker-part-5/featured.png" length="51170" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Kafka Development with Docker - Part 4 Producer and Consumer</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-01-kafka-development-with-docker-part-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-01-kafka-development-with-docker-part-4/</guid><description>In the previous post, we discussed Kafka Connect to stream data to/from a Kafka cluster. Kafka also includes the Producer/Consumer APIs that allow client applications to send/read streams of data to/from topics in a Kafka cluster. While the main Kafka project maintains only the Java clients, there are several open source projects that provide the Kafka client APIs in Python. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to develop producer/consumer applications using the kafka-python package.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-06-01-kafka-development-with-docker-part-4/featured.png" length="75255" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Kafka Development with Docker - Part 3 Kafka Connect</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-25-kafka-development-with-docker-part-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-25-kafka-development-with-docker-part-3/</guid><description>According to the documentation of Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect is a tool for scalably and reliably streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems. It makes it simple to quickly define connectors that move large collections of data into and out of Kafka. Kafka Connect supports two types of connectors - source and sink. Source connectors are used to ingest messages from external systems into Kafka topics while messages are ingested into external systems form Kafka topics with sink connectors.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-25-kafka-development-with-docker-part-3/featured.png" length="69998" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Kafka Development with Docker - Part 2 Management App</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-18-kafka-development-with-docker-part-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-18-kafka-development-with-docker-part-2/</guid><description>In the previous post, I illustrated how to create a topic and to produce/consume messages using the command utilities provided by Apache Kafka. It is not convenient, however, for example, when you consume serialised messages where their schemas are stored in a schema registry. Also, the utilities don&amp;rsquo;t support to browse or manage related resources such as connectors and schemas. Therefore, a Kafka management app can be a good companion for development, which helps monitor and manage resources on an easy-to-use user interface.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-18-kafka-development-with-docker-part-2/featured.png" length="59675" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Kafka Development with Docker - Part 1 Cluster Setup</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-04-kafka-development-with-docker-part-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-04-kafka-development-with-docker-part-1/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m teaching myself modern data streaming architectures on AWS, and Apache Kafka is one of the key technologies, which can be used for messaging, activity tracking, stream processing and so on. While applications tend to be deployed to cloud, it can be much easier if we develop and test those with Docker and Docker Compose locally. As the series title indicates, I plan to publish articles that demonstrate Kafka and related tools in Dockerized environments.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2023-05-04-kafka-development-with-docker-part-1/featured.png" length="98355" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
