Two dimension tables that keep product and user records are created as Type 2 slowly changing dimension (SCD Type 2) tables, and one transactional fact table is built to keep pizza orders. To improve query performance, the fact table is denormalized to pre-join records from the dimension tables using the array and struct data types.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-03-14-dbt-pizza-shop-6/featured.png" length="82921" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) Pizza Shop Demo - Part 5 Modelling on Amazon Athena</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-03-07-dbt-pizza-shop-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-03-07-dbt-pizza-shop-5/</guid><description>In Part 1 and Part 3, we developed data build tool (dbt) projects that target PostgreSQL and BigQuery using fictional pizza shop data. The data is modelled by SCD type 2 dimension tables and one transactional fact table. While the order records should be joined with dimension tables to get complete details for PostgreSQL, the fact table is denormalized using nested and repeated fields to improve query performance for BigQuery.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-03-07-dbt-pizza-shop-5/featured.png" length="61499" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) Pizza Shop Demo - Part 4 ETL on BigQuery via Airflow</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-22-dbt-pizza-shop-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-22-dbt-pizza-shop-4/</guid><description>In Part 3, we developed a dbt project that targets Google BigQuery with fictional pizza shop data.

The fact table is denormalized using nested and repeated fields for improving query performance. In this post, we discuss how to set up an ETL process on the project using Apache Airflow.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-22-dbt-pizza-shop-4/featured.png" length="89588" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) Pizza Shop Demo - Part 3 Modelling on BigQuery</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-08-dbt-pizza-shop-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-08-dbt-pizza-shop-3/</guid><description>In this series, we discuss practical examples of data warehouse and lakehouse development where data transformation is performed by the data build tool (dbt) and ETL is managed by Apache Airflow. In Part 1, we developed a dbt project on PostgreSQL using fictional pizza shop data. At the end, the data sets are modelled by two SCD type 2 dimension tables and one transactional fact table. In this post, we create a new dbt project that targets Google BigQuery.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-02-08-dbt-pizza-shop-3/featured.png" length="70297" type="image/png"/></item><item><title>Data Build Tool (dbt) Pizza Shop Demo - Part 2 ETL on PostgreSQL via Airflow</title><link>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-25-dbt-pizza-shop-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-25-dbt-pizza-shop-2/</guid><description>In this series of posts, we discuss data warehouse/lakehouse examples using data build tool (dbt) including ETL orchestration with Apache Airflow.

Moreover, it can be used for data lakehouse development thanks to open table formats such as Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi and Delta Lake. dbt supports key AWS analytics services and I wrote a series of posts that discuss how to utilise dbt with Redshift, Glue, EMR on EC2, EMR on EKS, and Athena. Those posts focus on platform integration, however, they do not show realistic ETL scenarios.</description><enclosure url="https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-01-18-dbt-pizza-shop-1/featured.png" length="85093" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
